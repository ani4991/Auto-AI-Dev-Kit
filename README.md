# Auto-AI-Dev-Kit
One Line Desc - Automated problem solver using AI techniques

Main Objective - To conduct experiments to see if the algorithm when facing numerous amounts of diverse problems, starts to learn some patterns in all of its solutions to those problems and gain the ability to map a novel problem in future with a list of feasible solutions ranked in the order of efficiency.

General Description:
Auto-AI-Dev-Kit is a software application that solves problems through techniques involving Artificial Intelligence. Given a problem statement, metric and a corresponding dataset this algorithm autonomously starts to run some scripts in the background that would involve solving the problem using multiple approaches and it records every detail along the way, stores them in a backend database which would be used to solve future problems by applying the knowledge it had gained by solving various problems in the past.
